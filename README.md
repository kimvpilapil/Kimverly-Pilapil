My name is *Kimverly* or *Kim* for short.
I was born in the Philippines and arrived in Australia back in 2010.
At home I can speak both Tagalog and Visaya; Philippines' national languages.
I graduated from RMIT back in 2018 and got my Bachelors of Nursing.
In the Philippines, if your child become a nurse, it is held in high regards
which includes boasting to the neighbour how smart your kid is.
This is why it is quite common for Filipinos to pursue nursing.
Hence why I'm doing this course; to explore endless possibilities with *TECHNOLOGY*
