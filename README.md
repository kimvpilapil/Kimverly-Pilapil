# ABOUT ME

![kimvee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62003066/77240397-7334d780-6c39-11ea-9b61-fd48cd3eb4d1.jpg)


My name is *Kimverly* or *Kim* for short.
I was born in the Philippines and arrived in Australia back in 2010.
At home I can speak both Tagalog and Visaya; Philippines' national languages.
I graduated from RMIT back in 2018 and got my Bachelors of Nursing.
In the Philippines, if your child become a nurse, it is held in high regards
which includes boasting to the neighbour how smart your kid is.
This is why it is quite common for Filipinos to pursue nursing.
Hence why I'm doing this course; to explore endless possibilities with *TECHNOLOGY*.

# Interest in IT 
<br/>
• *My interest in IT* originated with my love for anime and games. This is highly influence from an anime called "Sword Art Online" where people from around the world can play real-life online games using a high tech version of the VR device. I don't have much IT skills other than trying to fix my laptop when it lags during a game; just basic knowledge to get me through daily work. 

<br/>

<br/>

• *Why RMIT*? The "T" in RMIT literally stands for Technology. I have graduated from RMIT in 2018 and wouldn't mind studying in this
institution again as I find the environment and tutors really proactive and supportive towards their students. Plus its in the city, which means a variety of food to choose from during lunch. Although this is an online course, I like studying at the RMIT library in the city.

<br/>


• During my *studies*, I would like to diverge myself more towards game creation and programming. I want to be at the backstage where I can get full insight of how programmers develop each app/game/etc. from scratch. Would also like to learn where todays technology is headed in the future.
